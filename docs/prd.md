## Problem Being Solved and Target Market

My app aims to solve a problem experienced by many players of the Pokemon<sup>TM</sup> video game franchise. Pokemon battling is a major gameplay machanic present within the Pokemon video game series and has become more dominate with each generation. A primiary determining factor within this mechanic is Pokemon and move typings. A move has different effectiveness ratings depending on the typing of the move and of the pokemon it is being used on. With 18 distinctive typings and 898 different pokemon who can have up to two typings each it can get very confusing to keep track of when strategizing or in the heat of battle and online charts can be slow, difficult, or overwhelming to use. I hope to build an app that will both speed up and simplify the process.
